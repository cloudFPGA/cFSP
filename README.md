# cFSP

The **cloudFPGA Support Package (cFSP)** for the cloudFPGA project.

Currently, the cFSP includes a library for the control plane of cloudFPGA.

The cFSP control plane includes a [Python package](cFSPlib/python_api_client/README.md) which is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- OpenAPI version: 0.8
- Package version: 1.0.0

## Requirements.

Python 3.6+

## Installation & Usage

Setting up python virtual environment:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cloudFPGA/cFSP.git
cd cFSP/
which python3.8
/usr/bin/python3.8
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 cfenv
source cfenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Getting Started

### Setting up the credentials file for a user

Load the credentials for a user. If no credentials file exists, a template will be created.

```bash
./cfsp user load
```

![cfsp-user-load](doc/img/2.png)

You may edit this file with your ZYC2 username and password.

![cfsp-user-json](doc/img/3.png)

> **_NOTE:_** You may provide a spcific configuration file instead the default (user.json), by using the option `-c my_custom_file` (or `--config my_custom_file`), e.g.

```bash
./cfsp user load /home/user/user.json
```

### Uploading an image

Assuming you want to upload the FPGA image which is stored at `/tmp/4_topFMKU60_impl_monolithic.bit`

```bash
./cfsp image post --image_file=4_topFMKU60_impl_monolithic.bit

```
